# LabView Community Edition inside Docker Environment on Ubuntu

Due to the LabView Community Edition for Linux that is designed for Fedora (with RPM), 
this project contributes scripts to build, install, and run it via Docker system under Ubuntu. 


## Quick Start

On Ubuntu that had already installed Docker system:

* Download and extract the LabView ISO file into a directory named 'lv_iso'.
* Run `> build.sh`
* Run `> run.sh`
